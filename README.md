# Heuristic Evaluation of eConestoga Application

**Evaluator Name**: Ankit Soni  
**Device/ Browser/ OS**: Windows 10, Google Chrome  
**Application**: eConestoga

---

## Introduction

This heuristic evaluation assesses the usability of the eConestoga application, conducted by me, Ankit Soni. The evaluation is based on Nielsen's ten heuristics, aiming to identify usability issues and recommend improvements. Each issue identified reflects my analysis and understanding of user interaction challenges within the application. The recommendations provided are tailored to enhance user experience and usability, ensuring the application meets the expectations of its users effectively.

## Heuristic Evaluation Table

| **Heuristic**                               | **Violation**                                                                                          | **Recommendation**                                                                                              | **Severity** |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **1. Visibility of System Status**          | The application does not always display a loading indicator when data is being fetched.                | Implement a consistent loading spinner or progress bar to inform users that the system is processing their request. | 3            |
| **2. Match Between System and the Real World** | Some of the terms used in the error messages are technical and not easily understood by users.          | Revise error messages to use plain language that reflects common terms users are familiar with.                   | 2            |
| **3. User Control and Freedom**             | There is no easy way to undo or redo actions, especially when navigating between different modules.    | Provide an 'Undo' option for critical actions and a 'Back' button for easier navigation.                          | 3            |
| **4. Consistency and Standards**            | Inconsistent button styles are used across different parts of the application, leading to confusion.   | Standardize button styles and colors throughout the application to maintain consistency.                          | 2            |
| **5. Error Prevention**                     | Users can submit forms without filling out mandatory fields, leading to submission errors.             | Implement client-side validation to ensure all required fields are filled before form submission.                 | 3            |
| **6. Recognition Rather Than Recall**       | Users are required to remember the navigation path they took to reach a specific module.                | Provide breadcrumb navigation to help users easily track and return to previous sections.                         | 2            |
| **7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**    | There are no keyboard shortcuts available for power users, making navigation cumbersome.               | Introduce keyboard shortcuts for common actions to enhance efficiency for experienced users.                      | 2            |
| **8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**      | Some screens are cluttered with too much information, overwhelming the users.                          | Simplify the interface by grouping related information and using whitespace effectively.                          | 2            |
| **9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors** | Error messages are generic and do not provide enough information to diagnose the issue.                 | Enhance error messages to include details about the error and steps to resolve it.                                | 3            |
| **10. Help and Documentation**              | There is no easily accessible help documentation within the application.                               | Include a help section or tooltips that provide guidance on using different features of the application.            | 2            |
