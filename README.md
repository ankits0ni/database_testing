# Heuristic Evaluation of eConestoga Application

**Evaluator Name**: Ankit Soni  
**Device/ Browser/ OS**: Windows 10, Google Chrome  
**Application**: eConestoga

## Introduction

This document presents my heuristic evaluation of the eConestoga application, focusing on identifying usability issues based on Nielsen's ten heuristics. The evaluation aims to provide insights into how well the application meets usability standards and to suggest improvements that can enhance user experience. Each heuristic violation is analyzed from my perspective, with recommendations provided to address these issues effectively.

## Heuristic Evaluation Table

| **Heuristic**                               | **Violation**                                                                                          | **Recommendation**                                                                                              | **Severity** |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **1. Visibility of System Status**          | The application fails to consistently display a loading indicator during data fetching processes.       | Implement a consistent loading spinner or progress bar to inform users about ongoing processes.                  | 3            |
| **2. Match Between System and the Real World** | Error messages contain technical jargon that may confuse users rather than clarify issues.             | Use plain language in error messages to ensure they are easily understandable by all users.                      | 2            |
| **3. User Control and Freedom**             | Users lack an option to undo or redo actions, especially when navigating between different modules.    | Introduce an 'Undo' feature and a 'Back' button to provide users more control over their actions.                | 3            |
| **4. Consistency and Standards**            | Button styles across different sections of the application vary, leading to user confusion.            | Standardize button styles and colors across the application to maintain a cohesive user interface.               | 2            |
| **5. Error Prevention**                     | Mandatory form fields are not clearly marked, resulting in incomplete submissions.                     | Implement client-side validation to ensure all required fields are filled out before form submission.           | 3            |
| **6. Recognition Rather Than Recall**       | Users must remember the exact path they took to navigate to specific sections of the application.      | Introduce breadcrumb navigation to help users easily track and return to previous sections.                       | 2            |
| **7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**    | Lack of keyboard shortcuts makes it cumbersome for power users to navigate quickly through the app.     | Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions to enhance efficiency for experienced users.                      | 2            |
| **8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**      | Some screens are cluttered with excessive information, overwhelming users' visual experience.          | Simplify screen layouts by grouping related information and utilizing whitespace effectively.                      | 2            |
| **9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors** | Error messages provide limited information, making it challenging for users to troubleshoot issues.   | Enhance error messages with specific details and instructions on how to resolve common problems.                  | 3            |
| **10. Help and Documentation**              | Access to help documentation within the app is lacking, leaving users without immediate assistance.     | Incorporate a comprehensive help section or tooltips to guide users on using different app features.             | 2            |

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this heuristic evaluation highlights critical areas where the eConestoga application can improve its usability. The recommendations provided are based on my analysis and understanding of user interaction challenges within the app. By addressing these issues, eConestoga can enhance its user interface and experience, ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction and efficiency. Continuous evaluation and refinement based on user feedback will be crucial in maintaining and improving usability standards over time.
