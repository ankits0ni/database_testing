| **Heuristic**                               | **Violation**                                                                                          | **Recommendation**                                                                                              | **Severity** |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **1. Visibility of System Status**          | The application fails to consistently display a loading indicator during data fetching processes.       | Implement a regular loading spinner or progress bar to inform users about ongoing processes.                   | 3            |
| **2. Match Between System and the Real World** | Error messages contain technical jargon that can confuse users rather than clarify issues.             | Use simple language in error messages to ensure they are easily understandable by all users.                    | 2            |
| **3. User Control and Freedom**             | Users lack an option to undo or redo actions, especially when navigating between different modules.    | Introduce an 'Undo' feature and a 'Back' button to provide users more control over their actions.                | 3            |
| **4. Consistency and Standards**            | Button styles across different sections of the application vary, leading to user confusion.            | Standardize button styles and colors throughout the application to maintain a cohesive user interface.          | 2            |
| **5. Error Prevention**                     | Mandatory form fields are not clearly marked, resulting in incomplete submissions.                     | Implement client-side validation to ensure all required fields are filled out before form submission.           | 3            |
| **6. Recognition Rather Than Recall**       | Users must remember the exact path they took to navigate to specific sections of the application.      | Introduce breadcrumb navigation to help users easily track and return to previous sections.                      | 2            |
| **7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**    | Lack of keyboard shortcuts makes it cumbersome for power users to navigate quickly through the app.     | Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions to enhance efficiency for experienced users.                     | 2            |
| **8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**      | Some screens are cluttered with excessive information, overwhelming users' visual experience.          | Simplify screen layouts by grouping related information and using whitespace effectively.                        | 2            |
| **9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors** | Error messages provide limited information, making it difficult for users to troubleshoot issues.   | Enhance error messages with specific details and instructions on how to resolve common problems.                  | 3            |
| **10. Help and Documentation**              | Access to help documentation within the app is lacking, leaving users without immediate assistance.     | Include a comprehensive help section or tooltips to guide users on using different app features.                | 2            |
